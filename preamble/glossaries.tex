% Package for flexible glossaries; I had issues with nomencl and this will allow more centralized configuration anyway. Also supports acronyms, though I am not yet transitioning those yet.
% configuring glossaries-extra to use bib2gls and also provide accessibility support just in case you want to use it for symbols or whatever that wouldn't screen-read right; treating undefined glossary entries as warnings to match standard missing-reference stuff is automatically integrated into record because of how bib2gls works.
% important: this must come AFTER hyperref, babel, polyglossia, inputenc and fontenc!
\usepackage[record,accsupp, % accessibility support
  postdot,% full stop after description; may be better to use post-description-dot per resource entry
  nostyles,% don't load default style packages; this is the recommendation
  % load glossaries-extra-stylemods.sty and tree, bookindex, long/list for abbrevs
  stylemods={tree,bookindex,long,list}, % index(group) doesn't fail when you don't include tree but latexmk errored out due to lack of stabilization
  style=indexgroup, % default style
  prefix, % for a(n) configuration
  abbreviations,symbols,index,numbers % want these glossaries
