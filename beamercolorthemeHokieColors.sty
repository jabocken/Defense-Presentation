% Define colors, as described by University Relation's Web Palette Guidelines
%
% Most colors are described in four levels: 'light', 'normal', 'dark', and
% 'deep', in that order, where 'light' is the lightest, and 'deep' is the
% darkest. This is not the case for a few special colors, e.g., maroon, orange,
% and bgbrown.
